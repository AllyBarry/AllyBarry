# 👋 Hi, I’m Ally Barry

I’m an MSc student in the **[RAIL Lab](https://www.raillab.org/)** at **Wits University**, supervised by **Prof. Benjamin Rosman** and **Dr. Steven James**.  
My research explores how **agents can minimize communication while coordinating to achieve shared goals** - particularly in the space of **underground UAVs** 🤖🚁.

Outside of research, I’ve spent several years in **AI consulting**, focusing on **full-stack development** and **DevOps**.  
I hold **AWS Developer certifications** and have extensive experience designing and automating **end-to-end deployment pipelines**.

By day (and sometimes night!), I’m also the **CTO of a family truck insurance company**, where I’m leading a **system migration from legacy infrastructure** and architecting a **modern data-driven ecosystem** that’s reshaping how the company operates 🚛📊.

Within the RAIL Lab, I manage our growing fleet of robots - from **Pepper** to **BlueROV2** - developing tutorials, documenting systems, maintaining hardware, and upskilling others in the lab on the **electronics and integration** side.  

I hold a **BSc(Eng) in Mechatronics Engineering** from **UCT**, where I first learned to bridge the gap between **circuits, code, and creative problem-solving** ⚙️💡.
